# ExtrIcons
Extra icons which aren't included in the awesome [Font Awesome project](http://fontawesome.io/) but should be, saved in a font and addressed in CSS so you can just use it like Font Awesome.
You could easily use this as an extension to your Font-Awesome or Glyphicons iconset.

## Icons

* Teamspeak 3 icon
* Discord icon
* ... want to have more? Just create an issue with a SVG file or create a pull request!

You can find an overview about the [icons on the demo.html](https://jmgraeffe.github.io/extricons/demo.html) (there you will find the names too).

## How to use it

Add the CSS reference to your HTML header:

    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="extricons.css" />

Then you can use the icons everywhere, like:

    <i class="ei-teamspeak"></i>
